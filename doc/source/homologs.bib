  abstract = {In meiosis, the exchange of DNA between chromosomes by homologous recombination is a critical step that ensures proper chromosome segregation and increases genetic diversity. Products of recombination include reciprocal exchanges, known as crossovers, and non-reciprocal gene conversions or non-crossovers. The mechanisms underlying meiotic recombination remain elusive, largely because of the difficulty of analyzing large numbers of recombination events by traditional genetic methods. These traditional methods are increasingly being superseded by high-throughput techniques capable of surveying meiotic recombination on a genome-wide basis. Next-generation sequencing or microarray hybridization is used to genotype thousands of polymorphic markers in the progeny of hybrid yeast strains. New computational tools are needed to perform this genotyping and to find and analyze recombination events. We have developed a suite of programs, ReCombine, for using short sequence reads from next-generation sequencing experiments to genotype yeast meiotic progeny. Upon genotyping, the program CrossOver, a component of ReCombine, then detects recombination products and classifies them into categories based on the features found at each location and their distribution among the various chromatids. CrossOver is also capable of analyzing segregation data from microarray experiments or other sources. This package of programs is designed to allow even researchers without computational expertise to use high-throughput, whole-genome methods to study the molecular mechanisms of meiotic recombination.},

  abstract = {We have studied DNA polymorphisms at loci in the pericentromeric region on the long arm of chromosome 21 in 200 families with trisomy 21, in order to determine the meiotic origin of nondisjunction. Maintenance of heterozygosity for parental markers in the individual with trisomy 21 was interpreted as resulting from a meiosis I error, while reduction to homozygosity was attributed to a meiosis II error. Nondisjunction was paternal in 9 cases and was maternal in 188 cases, as reported earlier. Among the 188 maternal cases, nondisjunction occurred in meiosis I in 128 cases and in meiosis II in 38 cases; in 22 cases the DNA markers used were uninformative. Therefore meiosis I was responsible for 77.1\% and meiosis II for 22.9\% of maternal nondisjunction. Among the 9 paternal nondisjunction cases the error occurred in meiosis I in 2 cases (22.2\%) and in meiosis II in 7 (77.8\%) cases. Since there was no significant difference in the distribution of maternal ages between maternal I error versus maternal II error, it is unlikely that an error at a particular meiotic stage contributes significantly to the increasing incidence of Down syndrome with advancing maternal age. Although the DNA polymorphisms used were at loci which map close to the centromere, it is likely that rare errors in meiotic-origin assignments may have occurred because of a small number of crossovers between the markers and the centromere. Analysis of these polymorphisms may provide a more accurate understanding of the meiotic stage of nondisjunction in trisomy 21 than that previously provided by chromosomal heteromorphisms.},

At 33؇C, recombination-initiating double-strand breaks (DSBs) and noncrossover products (NCRs) form normally while formation of singleend invasion strand exchange intermediates (SEIs), double Holliday junctions, crossover products (CRs), and SC are coordinately defective. Thus, during wildtype meiosis, recombinational interactions are differentiated into CR and NCR types very early, prior to onset of stable strand exchange and independent of SC. By implication, crossover interference does not require SC formation. We suggest that SC formation may require interference. Subsequently, CR-designated DSBs undergo a tightly coupled, ZMM-promoted transition that yields SEI-containing recombination complexes embedded in patches of SC. zmm mutant phenotypes differ strikingly at 33؇C and 23؇C, implicating higher temperature as a positive effector of recombination and identifying a checkpoint that monitors local CR-specific events, not SC formation, at late leptotene.},

  abstract = {Pairing of homologous chromosomes is a crucial step in meiosis, which in fission yeast depends on nuclear oscillations. However, how nuclear oscillations help pairing is unknown. Here, we show that homologous loci typically pair when the spindle pole body is at the cell pole and the nucleus is elongated, whereas they unpair when the spindle pole body is in the cell center and the nucleus is round. Inhibition of oscillations demonstrated that movement is required for initial pairing and that prolonged association of loci leads to mis-segregation. The double-strand break marker Rec25 accumulates in elongated nuclei, indicating that prolonged chromosome stretching triggers recombinatory pathways leading to mis-segregation. Mis-segregation is rescued by overexpression of the Holliday junction resolvase Mus81, suggesting that prolonged pairing results in irresolvable recombination intermediates. We conclude that nuclear oscillations exhibit a dual role, promoting initial pairing and restricting the time of chromosome associations to ensure proper segregation.},

Crossovers establish chiasmata, which are physical connections between homologous chromosomes that provide the tension necessary to align chromosomes on the meiotic spindle. Understanding the mechanisms underlying crossover control has been hampered by the difficulty in determining crossover distributions. Here, we present a microarray-based method to analyze multiple aspects of crossover control simultaneously and rapidly, at high resolution, genomewide, and on a cell-by-cell basis. Using this approach, we show that loss of interference in zip2 and zip4/spo22 mutants is accompanied by a reduction in crossover homeostasis, thus connecting these two levels of crossover control. We also provide evidence to suggest that repression of crossing over at telomeres and centromeres arises from different mechanisms. Lastly, we uncover a surprising role for the synaptonemal complex component Zip1 in repressing crossing over at the centromere.},

  abstract = {Meiosis is a specialized cellular program required to create haploid gametes from diploid parent cells. Homologous chromosomes pair, synapse, and recombine in a dynamic environment that accommodates gross chromosome reorganization and significant chromosome motion, which are critical for normal chromosome segregation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ndj1 is a meiotic telomere-associated protein required for physically attaching telomeres to proteins embedded in the nuclear envelope. In this study, we identified additional proteins that act at the nuclear periphery from meiotic cell extracts, including Nup2, a nonessential nucleoporin with a known role in tethering interstitial chromosomal loci to the nuclear pore complex. We found that deleting NUP2 affects meiotic progression and spore viability, and gives increased levels of recombination intermediates and products. We identified a previously uncharacterized 125 aa region of Nup2 that is necessary and sufficient for its meiotic function, thus behaving as a meiotic autonomous region (MAR). Nup2-MAR forms distinct foci on spread meiotic chromosomes, with a subset overlapping with Ndj1 foci. Localization of Nup2-MAR to meiotic chromosomes does not require Ndj1, nor does Ndj1 localization require Nup2, suggesting these proteins function in different pathways, and their interaction is weak or indirect. Instead, several severe synthetic phenotypes are associated with the nup2D ndj1D double mutant, including delayed turnover of recombination joint molecules, and a failure to undergo nuclear divisions without also arresting the meiotic program. These data suggest Nup2 and Ndj1 support partially overlapping functions that promote two different levels of meiotic chromosome organization necessary to withstand a dynamic stage of the eukaryotic life cycle.},

  abstract = {The nuclear envelope (NE) presents a physical boundary between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm, sandwiched in between two highly active systems inside the cell: cytoskeleton and chromatin. NE defines the shape and size of the cell nucleus, which increases during the cell cycle, accommodating for chromosome decondensation followed by genome duplication. In this work, we study nuclear shape fluctuations at short time scales of seconds in human cells. Using spinning disk confocal microscopy, we observe fast fluctuations of the NE, visualized by fluorescently labeled lamin A, and of the chromatin globule surface (CGS) underneath the NE, visualized by fluorescently labeled histone H2B. Our findings reveal that fluctuation amplitudes of both CGS and NE monotonously decrease during the cell cycle, serving as a reliable cell cycle stage indicator. Remarkably, we find that, while CGS and NE typically fluctuate in phase, they do exhibit localized regions of out-of-phase motion, which lead to separation of NE and CGS. To explore the mechanism behind these shape fluctuations, we use biochemical perturbations. We find the shape fluctuations of CGS and NE to be both thermally and actively driven, the latter caused by forces from chromatin and cytoskeleton. Such undulations might affect gene regulation as well as contribute to the anomalously high rates of nuclear transport by, e.g., stirring of molecules next to NE, or increasing flux of molecules through the nuclear pores.},

This sorting and pairing is accompanied by active chromosome positioning in meiotic prophase in which telomeres cluster near the spindle pole to form the bouquet before dispersing around the nuclear envelope. We now describe telomere-led rapid prophase movements (RPMs) that frequently exceed 1 mm/s and persist throughout meiotic prophase. Bouquet formation and RPMs depend on NDJ1, MPS3, and a new member of this pathway, CSM4, which encodes a meiosis-specific nuclear envelope protein required specifically for telomere mobility. RPMs initiate independently of recombination but differ quantitatively in mutants that fail to complete recombination, suggesting that RPMs respond to recombination status. Together with recombination defects described for ndj1, our observations suggest that RPMs and SCs balance the disruption and stabilization of recombinational interactions, respectively, to regulate crossing over.},

These associations occur only if TetR molecules are present. tetO tandem repeats associate regardless of their chromosomal context.

Associations are established at G1 and are reduced during S-phase and mitosis.

SEIs are products of strand exchange between one DSB end and its homolog. The structural asymmetry of SEIs indicates that the two ends of a DSB interact with the homolog in temporal succession, via structurally (and thus biochemically) distinct processes. SEIs arise surprisingly late in prophase, concomitant with synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. These and other data imply that SEIs are preceded by nascent DSB-partner intermediates, which then undergo selective differentiation into crossover and noncrossover types, with SC formation and strand exchange as downstream consequences. Late occurrence of strand exchange provides opportunity to reverse recombinational fate even after homologs are coaligned and/or synapsed. This feature can explain crossover suppression between homeologous and structurally heterozygous chromosomes.},

Opposite to the centromeric pole is the nucleolus. Chromosome arms extend outwards from the centromeric pole and are preferentially directed towards the opposite pole. Centromere clustering is reduced by the ndc10 mutation, which affects a kinetochore protein, and by the microtubule poison nocodazole. This suggests that clustering is actively maintained or enforced by the association of centromeres with microtubules throughout interphase. Unlike the Rabl-orientation known from many higher eukaryotes, centromere clustering in yeast is not only a relic of anaphase chromosome polarization, because it can be reconstituted without the passage of cells through anaphase. Within the rosette, homologous centromeres are not arranged in a particular order that would suggest somatic pairing or genome separation.},

  abstract = {Meiotic double-strand break (DSB)-initiated recombination must occur between homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes (``homolog bias''), even though sister chromatids are present. Through physical recombination analyses, we show that sister cohesion, normally mediated by meiotic cohesin Rec8, promotes ``sister bias''; that meiosis-specific axis components Red1/Mek1kinase counteract this effect, thereby satisfying an essential precondition for homolog bias; and that other components, probably recombinosome-related, directly ensure homolog partner selection. Later, Rec8 acts positively to ensure maintenance of bias. These complexities mirror opposing dictates for global sister cohesion versus local separation and differentiation of sisters at recombination sites. Our findings support DSB formation within axis-tethered recombinosomes containing both sisters and ensuing programmed sequential release of ``first'' and ``second'' DSB ends. First-end release would create a homologysearching ``tentacle.'' Rec8 and Red1/Mek1 also independently license recombinational progression and abundantly localize to different domains. These domains could comprise complementary environments that integrate inputs from DSB repair and mitotic chromosome morphogenesis into the complete meiotic program.},

  abstract = {The segregation of homologous chromosomes during the Meiosis I division requires an obligate crossover per homolog pair (crossover assurance). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammals, Msh4 and Msh5 proteins stabilize Holliday junctions and its progenitors to facilitate crossing over. S. cerevisiae msh4/5 hypomorphs that reduce crossover levels up to twofold at specific loci on chromosomes VII, VIII, and XV without affecting homolog segregation were identified recently. We use the msh4\textendash R676W hypomorph to ask if the obligate crossover is insulated from variation in crossover frequencies, using a S. cerevisiae S288c/YJM789 hybrid to map recombination genome-wide. The msh4\textendash R676W hypomorph made on average 64 crossovers per meiosis compared to 94 made in wild type and 49 in the msh4{$\Delta$} mutant confirming the defect seen at individual loci on a genome-wide scale. Crossover reductions in msh4\textendash R676W and msh4{$\Delta$} were significant across chromosomes regardless of size, unlike previous observations made at specific loci. The msh4\textendash R676W hypomorph showed reduced crossover interference. Although crossover reduction in msh4\textendash R676W is modest, 42\% of the four viable spore tetrads showed nonexchange chromosomes. These results, along with modeling of crossover distribution, suggest the significant reduction in crossovers across chromosomes and the loss of interference compromises the obligate crossover in the msh4 hypomorph. The high spore viability of the msh4 hypomorph is maintained by efficient segregation of the natural nonexchange chromosomes. Our results suggest that variation in crossover frequencies can compromise the obligate crossover and also support a mechanistic role for interference in obligate crossover formation.},

  abstract = {Chromosome pairing in meiotic prophase is a prerequisite for the high fidelity of chromosome segregation that haploidizes the genome prior to gamete formation. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as in most multicellular eukaryotes, homologous pairing at the cytological level reflects the contemporaneous search for homology at the molecular level, where DNA double-strand broken ends find and interact with templates for repair on homologous chromosomes. Synapsis (synaptonemal complex formation) stabilizes pairing and supports DNA repair. The bouquet stage, where telomeres have formed a transient single cluster early in meiotic prophase, and telomere-promoted rapid meiotic prophase chromosome movements (RPMs) are prominent temporal correlates of pairing and synapsis. The bouquet has long been thought to contribute to the kinetics of pairing, but the individual roles of bouquet and RPMs are difficult to assess because of common dependencies. For example, in budding yeast RPMs and bouquet both require the broadly conserved SUN protein Mps3 as well as Ndj1 and Csm4, which link telomeres to the cytoskeleton through the intact nuclear envelope. We find that mutants in these genes provide a graded series of RPM activity: wild-type.mps3-dCC.mps3-dAR.ndj1D.mps3-dNT = csm4D. Pairing rates are directly correlated with RPM activity even though only wild-type forms a bouquet, suggesting that RPMs promote homologous pairing directly while the bouquet plays at most a minor role in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A new collision trap assay demonstrates that RPMs generate homologous and heterologous chromosome collisions in or before the earliest stages of prophase, suggesting that RPMs contribute to pairing by stirring the nuclear contents to aid the recombination-mediated homology search.},

A shared feature of RPMs is that the force that drives the chromosomal movements is transmitted from the cytoskeleton, through the nuclear envelope, to the telomeres. Studies in mice suggested that dynein movement along microtubules is transmitted to telomeres through SUN1/KASH5 nuclear envelope bridges to generate RPMs. We monitored RPMs in mouse seminiferous tubules using four-dimensional fluorescence imaging and quantitative motion analysis to characterize patterns of movement in the RPM process. We find that RPMs reflect a combination of nuclear rotation and individual chromosome movements. The telomeres move along microtubule tracks which are apparently continuous with the cytoskeletal network, and exhibit characteristic arrangements at different stages of prophase. Quantitative measurements confirmed that SUN1/KASH5, microtubules, and dynein but not actin were necessary for RPMs and that defects in meiotic recombination and synapsis resulted in altered RPMs.},

The pairing of homologous chromosomes is a critical aspect of meiotic prophase I that aids proper disjunction at anaphase I. We have used a site-specific recombination assay in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to examine allelic interaction levels during meiosis in a series of mutants defective in recombination, chromatin structure, or intracellular movement. Red1, a component of the chromosome axis, and Mnd1, a chromosome-binding protein that facilitates interhomolog interaction, are critical for achieving high levels of allelic interaction. Homologous recombination factors (Sae2, Rdh54, Rad54, Rad55, Rad51, Sgs1) aid in varying degrees in promoting allelic interactions, while the Srs2 helicase appears to play no appreciable role. Ris1 (a SWI2/ SNF2 related protein) and Dot1 (a histone methyltransferase) appear to play minor roles. Surprisingly, factors involved in microtubule-mediated intracellular movement (Tub3, Dhc1, and Mlp2) appear to play no appreciable role in homolog juxtaposition, unlike their counterparts in fission yeast. Taken together, these results support the notion that meiotic recombination plays a major role in the high levels of homolog interaction observed during budding yeast meiosis.},

We implement a binding model in which HP1 preferentially binds to trimethylated histone tails and then oligomerizes to bridge together nucleosomes. We observe a phase reminiscent of heterochromatin\textemdash dense and high in H3K9me3\textemdash and another reminiscent of euchromatin\textemdash less dense and lacking H3K9me3. This segregation results in a plaid contact probability map that matches the general shape and position of published Hi-C data. Analysis suggests that a roughly 20-kb segment of H3K9me3 enrichment is required to drive segregation into the heterochromatic phase.},

  abstract = {Background: Structural studies of fixed cells have revealed that interphase chromosomes are highly organized into specific arrangements in the nucleus, and have led to a picture of the nucleus as a static structure with immobile chromosomes held in fixed positions, an impression apparently confirmed by recent photobleaching studies. Functional studies of chromosome behavior, however, suggest that many essential processes, such as recombination, require interphase chromosomes to move around within the nucleus. Results: To reconcile these contradictory views, we exploited methods for tagging specific chromosome sites in living cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with green fluorescent protein and in Drosophila melanogaster with fluorescently labeled topoisomerase II. Combining these techniques with submicrometer single-particle tracking, we directly measured the motion of interphase chromatin, at high resolution and in three dimensions. We found that chromatin does indeed undergo significant diffusive motion within the nucleus, but this motion is constrained such that a given chromatin segment is free to move within only a limited subregion of the nucleus. Chromatin diffusion was found to be insensitive to metabolic inhibitors, suggesting that it results from classical Brownian motion rather than from active motility. Nocodazole greatly reduced chromatin confinement, suggesting a role for the cytoskeleton in the maintenance of nuclear architecture. Conclusions: We conclude that chromatin is free to undergo substantial Brownian motion, but that a given chromatin segment is confined to a subregion of the nucleus. This constrained diffusion is consistent with a highly defined nuclear architecture, but also allows enough motion for processes requiring chromosome motility to take place. These results lead to a model for the regulation of chromosome interactions by nuclear architecture.},

  abstract = {The recognition and pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis is a complex physical and molecular process involving a combination of polymer dynamics and molecular recognition events. Two highly conserved features of meiotic chromosome behavior are the attachment of telomeres to the nuclear envelope and the active random motion of telomeres driven by their interaction with cytoskeletal motor proteins. Both of these features have been proposed to facilitate the process of homolog pairing, but exactly what role these features play in meiosis remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the roles of active motion and nuclear envelope tethering using a Brownian dynamics simulation in which meiotic chromosomes are represented by a Rouse polymer model subjected to tethering and active forces at the telomeres. We find that tethering telomeres to the nuclear envelope slows down pairing relative to the rates achieved by unattached chromosomes, but that randomly directed active forces applied to the telomeres speed up pairing dramatically in a manner that depends on the statistical properties of the telomere force fluctuations. The increased rate of initial pairing cannot be explained by stretching out of the chromosome conformation but instead seems to correlate with anomalous diffusion of sub-telomeric regions.},

  abstract = {Meiotic homolog pairing involves associations between homologous DNA regions scattered along the length of a chromosome. When homologs associate, they tend to do so by a processive zippering process, which apparently results from avidity effects. Using a computational model, we show that this avidity-driven processive zippering reduces the selectivity of pairing. When active random forces are applied to telomeres, this drop in selectivity is eliminated in a force-dependent manner. Further simulations suggest that active telomere forces are engaged in a tug-of-war against zippering, which can be interpreted as a Brownian ratchet with a stall force that depends on the dissociation constant of pairing. When perfectly homologous regions of high affinity compete with homeologous regions of lower affinity, the affinity difference can be amplified through this tug of war effect provided the telomere force acts in a range that is strong enough to oppose zippering of homeologs while still permitting zippering of correct homologs. The degree of unzippering depends on the radius of the nucleus, such that complete unzippering of homeologous regions can only take place if the nucleus is large enough to pull the two chromosomes completely apart. A picture of meiotic pairing thus emerges that is fundamentally mechanical in nature, possibly explaining the purpose of active telomere forces, increased nuclear diameter, and the presence of `Maverick' chromosomes in meiosis.},

Recombination initiates with an excess number of double-strand breaks made by Spo11 protein. Thus, crossover control involves a decision by which some breaks give crossovers while others follow a predominantly noncrossover pathway(s). To understand this decision, we examined recombination when breaks are reduced in yeast spo11 hypomorphs. We find that crossover levels tend to be maintained at the expense of noncrossovers and that genomic loci differ in expression of this ``crossover homeostasis.'' These findings define a previously unsuspected manifestation of crossover control, i.e., that the crossover/noncrossover ratio can change to maintain crossovers. Our results distinguish between existing models of crossover control and support the hypothesis that an obligate crossover is a genetically programmed event tied to crossover interference.},

In several cases, juxtaposition of such arrays located on different chromosomes has been inferred to reflect pairing of the corresponding loci. Here, we report that a version of TetR-GFP mutated to disrupt GFP dimerization (TetR-A206KGFP or ``TetR-kGFP''), abolishes pairing of tetO-arrays in vivo and brings spatial proximity of chromosomal loci marked with those arrays back to the wild type level. These data argue that pairing of arrays is caused by GFP dimerization and thus presents an example of protein-assisted interaction in chromosomes. Arrays marked with another protein, TetR-tdTomato, which has a propensity to form intra-molecular dimers instead of inter-molecular dimers, also display reduced level of pairing, supporting this idea. TetR-kGFP provides an improved system for studying chromosomal loci with a low pairing background.},

We discuss the possibility that the mitotic pathway for recombinational repair of DSBsserved as the primordial mechanism for connecting homologous chromosomes during the evolution of meiosis. DSBs disappear during the period when tripartite SC structure is forming and elongating (zygotene); presumably, they are converted to another type of recombination intermediate. Neither DSBs nor mature recombinant molecules are present when SCs are full length (pachytene). Mature reciprocally recombinant molecules arise at the end of or just after pachytene. We suggest that the SC might coordinate recombinant maturation with other events of meiosis.},

Recombining DNA sequences map to loops, but are ultimately tethered to the underlying axis. How and when such tethering occurs is currently unclear. Using ChIPchip in yeast, we show that Spo11-accessory proteins Rec114, Mer2, and Mei4 stably interact with chromosome axis sequences, upon phosphorylation of Mer2 by S phase Cdk. This axis tethering requires meiotic axis components (Red1/Hop1) and is modulated in a domain-specific fashion by cohesin. Loss of Rec114, Mer2, and Mei4 binding correlates with loss of DSBs. Our results strongly suggest that hotspot sequences become tethered to axis sites by the DSB machinery prior to DSB formation.},

The level of Cre-mediated recombination between a pair of loxP sites located at an allelic position on homologous chromosomes was 13-fold greater than that between a pair of loxP sites located at ectopic positions on nonhomologous chromosomes. Mutations affecting meiotic recombination initiation and the processing of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) into single-end invasions (SEIs) reduced the levels of allelic Cre-mediated recombination levels by three- to sixfold. The severity of Cre/loxP phenotypes is presented in contrast to relatively weak DSB-independent pairing defects as assayed using fluorescence in situ hybridization for these mutants. Mutations affecting synaptonemal complex (SC) formation or crossover control gave wild-type levels of allelic Cre-mediated recombination. A delay in attaining maximum levels of allelic Cre-mediated recombination was observed for a mutant defective in telomere clustering. None of the mutants affected ectopic levels of recombination.

In the budding yeast, DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and D loops form either crossovers (COs) or non-crossovers (NCOs), which occur at many sites in the genome. Differences at the nucleotide level associated with COs and NCOs enable us to detect these recombination events and their distributions. Results: We used high throughput sequencing to uncover over 46 thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between two budding yeast strains and investigated meiotic recombinational events. We provided a detailed analysis of CO and NCO events, including number, size range, and distribution on chromosomes. We have detected 91 COs, very close to the average number from previous genetic studies, as well as 21 NCO events and mapped the positions of these events with high resolution. We have obtained DNA sequence-level evidence for a wide range of sizes of chromosomal regions involved in CO and NCO events. We show that a large fraction of the COs are accompanied by gene conversion (GC), indicating that meiotic recombination changes allelic frequencies, in addition to redistributing existing genetic variations. Conclusion: This work is the first reported study of meiotic recombination using high throughput sequencing technologies. Our results show that high-throughput sequencing is a sensitive method to uncover at single-base resolution details of CO and NCO events, including some complex patterns, providing new clues about the mechanism of this fundamental process.},

Recombination is initiated by the formation of programmed double strand breaks (DSBs), which occur preferentially at places called DSB hotspots. Among all DSBs generated, only a small fraction is repaired by crossover, the other being repaired by other homologous recombination pathways. Crossover maps have been generated in a number of organisms, defining crossover hotspots.

  abstract = {Meiotic chromosome pairing involves not only recognition of homology but also juxtaposition of entire chromosomes in a topologically regular way. Analysis of filamentous fungus Sordaria macrospora reveals that recombination proteins Mer3, Msh4, and Mlh1 play direct roles in all of these aspects, in advance of their known roles in recombination. Absence of Mer3 helicase results in interwoven chromosomes, thereby revealing the existence of features that specifically ensure ``entanglement avoidance.'' Entanglements that remain at zygotene, i.e., ``interlockings,'' require Mlh1 for resolution, likely to eliminate constraining recombinational connections. Patterns of Mer3 and Msh4 foci along aligned chromosomes show that the double-strand breaks mediating homologous alignment have spatially separated ends, one localized to each partner axis, and that pairing involves interference among developing interhomolog interactions. We propose that Mer3, Msh4, and Mlh1 execute all of these roles during pairing by modulating the state of nascent double-strand break/partner DNA contacts within axis-associated recombination complexes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe an algorithmic framework for the automatic detection of diffraction-limited fluorescent spots in 3D optical images at a separation below the Rayleigh limit, i.e. with super-resolution. We demonstrate the potential of super-resolution detection by tracking fluorescently tagged chromosomes during mitosis in budding yeast. Our biological objective is to identify and analyse the proteins responsible for the generation of tensile force during chromosome segregation. Dynamic measurements in living cells are made possible by green fluroescent protein (GFP)-tagging chromosomes and spindle pole bodies to generate cells carrying four fluorescent spots, and observe the motion of the spots over time using 3Dfluorescence microscopy. The central problem in spot detection arises with the partial or complete overlap of spots when tagged objects are separated by distances below the resolution of the optics. To detect multiple spots under these conditions, a set of candidate mixture models is built, and the best candidate is selected from the set based on {$\chi$}2-statistics of the residuals in least-square fits of the models to the image data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meiotic pairing is essential for the proper orientation of chromosomes at the metaphase plate and their subsequent disjunction during anaphase I. In male Drosophila melanogaster, meiosis occurs in the absence of recombination or a recognizable synaptonemal complex (SC). Due to limitations in available cytological techniques, the early stages of homologous chromosome pairing in male Drosophila have not been observed, and the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. RESULTS: Chromosome tagging with GFP-Lac repressor protein allowed us to track, for the first time, the behavior of meiotic chromosomes at high resolution, live, at all stages of male Drosophila meiosis. Homologous chromosomes pair throughout the euchromatic regions in spermatogonia and during the early phases of spermatocyte development. Extensive separation of homologs and sister chromatids along the chromosome arms occurs in mid-G2, several hours before the first meiotic division, and before the G2/M transition. Centromeres, on the other hand, show complex association patterns, with specific homolog pairing taking place in mid-G2. These changes in chromosome pairing parallel changes in large-scale chromosome organization. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that widespread interactions along the euchromatin are required for the initiation, but not the maintenance, of meiotic pairing of autosomes in male Drosophila. We propose that heterochromatic associations, or chromatid entanglement, may be responsible for the maintenance of homolog association during late G2. Our data also suggest that the formation of chromosome territories in the spermatocyte nucleus may play an active role in ensuring the specificity of meiotic pairing in late prophase by disrupting interactions between nonhomologous chromosomes.},

In capturing telomere motions using quantitative imaging to acquire complete high-resolution three-dimensional datasets every second for 200 seconds, telomere dynamics were systematically analyzed. Results The motility of individual telomeres within the same cancer cell nucleus was widely heterogeneous. One class of internal heterochromatic regions of chromosomes analyzed moved more uniformly and showed less motion and heterogeneity than telomeres. The single telomere analyses in cancer cells revealed that shorter telomeres showed more motion, and the more rapid telomere motions were energy dependent. Experimentally increasing bulk telomere length dampened telomere motion. In contrast, telomere uncapping, but not a DNA damaging agent, methyl methanesulfonate, significantly increased telomere motion. Conclusion New methods for seconds-scale, four-dimensional, live cell microscopic imaging and data analysis, allowing systematic tracking of individual telomeres in live cells, have defined a previously undescribed form of telomere behavior in human cells, in which the degree of telomere motion was dependent upon telomere length and functionality.},

  abstract = {Meiotic chromosome segregation requires homologue pairing, synapsis, and crossover recombination, which occur during meiotic prophase. Telomere-led chromosome motion has been observed or inferred to occur during this stage in diverse species, but its mechanism and function remain enigmatic. In Caenorhabditis elegans, special chromosome regions known as pairing centers (PCs), rather than telomeres, associate with the nuclear envelope (NE) and the microtubule cytoskeleton. In this paper, we investigate chromosome dynamics in living animals through high-resolution four-dimensional fluorescence imaging and quantitative motion analysis. We find that chromosome movement is constrained before meiosis. Upon prophase onset, constraints are relaxed, and PCs initiate saltatory, processive, dynein-dependent motions along the NE. These dramatic motions are dispensable for homologous pairing and continue until synapsis is completed. These observations are consistent with the idea that motions facilitate pairing by enhancing the search rate but that their primary function is to trigger synapsis. This quantitative analysis of chromosome dynamics in a living animal extends our understanding of the mechanisms governing faithful genome inheritance.},

  abstract = {At the final step of homologous recombination, Holliday junction-containing joint molecules (JMs) are resolved to form crossover or noncrossover products. The enzymes responsible for JM resolution in vivo remain uncertain, but three distinct endonucleases capable of resolving JMs in vitro have been identified: Mus81-Mms4(EME1), Slx1-Slx4(BTBD12), and Yen1(GEN1). Using physical monitoring of recombination during budding yeast meiosis, we show that all three endonucleases are capable of promoting JM resolution in vivo. However, in mms4 slx4 yen1 triple mutants, JM resolution and crossing over occur efficiently. Paradoxically, crossing over in this background is strongly dependent on the Blooms helicase ortholog Sgs1, a component of a well-characterized anticrossover activity. Sgs1-dependent crossing over, but not JM resolution per se, also requires XPG family nuclease Exo1 and the MutLg complex Mlh1-Mlh3. Thus, Sgs1, Exo1, and MutLg together define a previously undescribed meiotic JM resolution pathway that produces the majority of crossovers in budding yeast and, by inference, in mammals.},

  abstract = {Recombination is a prominent feature of meiosis in which it plays an important role in increasing genetic diversity during inheritance. Additionally, in most organisms, recombination also plays mechanical roles in chromosomal processes, most notably to mediate pairing of homologous chromosomes during prophase and, ultimately, to ensure regular segregation of homologous chromosomes when they separate at the first meiotic division. Recombinational interactions are also subject to important spatial patterning at both early and late stages. Recombination-mediated processes occur in physical and functional linkage with meiotic axial chromosome structure, with interplay in both directions, before, during, and after formation and dissolution of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a highly conserved meiosis-specific structure that links homolog axes along their lengths. These diverse processes also are integrated with recombination-independent interactions between homologous chromosomes, nonhomology-based chromosome couplings/clusterings, and diverse types of chromosome movement. This review provides an overview of these diverse processes and their interrelationships.},
