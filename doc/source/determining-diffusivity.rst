Now that we have estimates for the Kuhn length of the polymer, its total length,
and the average radius of the nucleus, all of the relevant length scales of the
problem are fixed.

It would be difficult to extract any relevant time scales from the single-cell
trajectories, since they are largely plateaus even at the shortest time scales
of our experiment (:math:`t = 30s`). Therefore, in order to determine the time
scale, we can look to the ensemble averaged MSCD curves.

We first extract out the power-law "slope" of the WT, *URA3* MSCD curve for
:math:`T_3`:
