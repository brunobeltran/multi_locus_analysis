Analytical theory
=================

Here, we show some best practices for comparing MSDs, displacement
distributions, and velocity correlations to the theory of diffusing molecules.

The literature contains many good reviews on these topics, so we cover
often overlooked pitfalls.

First, we discuss the :ref:`effects of confinement <analytical-msds>` on
MSDs, especially on extracting diffusivity and the subdiffusivity
coefficient (i.e. Hurst
index).

Then, we discuss the effects of heterogeneity between cells on the :ref:`gaussianity
of the displacement distribution <analytical-disps-hist>` and what that looks like for real data.

Finally, we discuss how to use the velocity cross correlation of two
particles to :ref:`extract information <analytical-velocity-correlation>` about whether those two particles are connected
in a drift-independent manner.
