Finite window correction
========================

Measurements of "waiting times" or "survival times" taken within a finite
time interval require special statistical treatment to account for the bias
towards short measurements introduced by the measurement itself. For
mathematical details, see the manuscript in preparation `(Beltran et. al.,
