r"""``burgess`` Data Set

Various movies (many cells per movie) of yeast cells undergoing meiosis. In
each cell, two loci are tagged (in the same color). Various mutants and stages
of meiosis were imaged.

Data interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``df``
    The data.

``cell_cols``
    The columsn to groupby to get each unique "cell" (i.e. each pair of
    trajectories :math:`X_1(t_k)` and :math:`X_2(t_k)`.

``traj_cols``
    The columns to groupby to get each trajectory (one particle at a time).

``frame_cols``
    The columns to groupby to get each frame taken (including both particles).

``spot_cols``
    The columns to groupby to get localization (one spot at one time).

Data columns
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``locus``
    a designator of which locus was tagged. ``HET5`` corresponds to a
    heterozygous cross of the ``URA3`` and ``LYS2`` tags.

``genotype``
    ``WT`` for wildtype or ``SP`` for :math:`\Delta`\ *spo11*.

``exp.rep``
    an unique integer for each experimental replicate (only unique if
    all other ``movie_cols`` are specified.

``meiosis``
    the stage of progression through meiosis. movies were taken by spotting
    cells onto a slide every thirty minutes. the times are labelled ``t#``,
    where the number nominally corresponds to the number of hours since the
    cells were transferred to sporulation media, but don't take it very
    seriously.

``cell``
    unique identifier for the different cells in a given movie.

``frame``
    frame counter for each movie

``t``
    number of seconds since beginning of movie. since only 1/30s frame
    rates were used, this is just 30 times the ``frame`` column.

``X``
    x-coordinate of a loci

``Y``
    y-coordinate of a loci

``Z``
    z-coordinate of a loci
