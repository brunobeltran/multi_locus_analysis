"""Show various versions of the MS(C)D plots for the Burgess data, do some
simple analysis to extract effective diffusion coefficients, confinement
radii, etc.

The differences between MSD and MSCD, as well as those caused by splitting
the trajectories as opposed to treating bound and unbound as different
states of the same trajectory are explored.


There are several reasonable definitions for what a "trajectory" is in this
data.

    1) spot==1 positions and spot==2 positions, including the time when they
    spend being the "same spot", while they are not broken by internal NaN.
    2) spot==1 positions for a single cell, while they are not broken by an
    internal NaN. spot==2 positions only invalid when spots are paired, but
    assuming it makes sense to calculate velocities when at an intermediate
    time the spots where paired.
    3) spot==1 positions for a single cell, while they are not broken by an
    internal NaN. spot==2 positions only valid in between times they are
    paired, assuming that it makes no sense to calculate velocities between
    two unpaired times when there is an intermediate "pair" time.
    4) spot==1 positions and spot==2 positions, only when they are not bound
    together. separately, spot==1&2 positions.

(1) is easily extracted from the default state of burgess.df, e.g. in
burgess.make_all_intermediates, where the MSCD is saved in msds_movies_file.

(2) requires breaking up spot==2 trajectories by "wait_id", defined in add_wait_id

(3) requires simply setting spot==2 to NaN when paired, not breaking up by
wait_id

(4) requires simply taking "pair" and "unp" times separately into the
calculations. (after breaking up by wait_id).

These different interpretations lead to several different MS(C)D's::

    a) (from (1)) MSCDs after groupby(cell_cols)
    b) (from (2)) MSCDs after groupby(cell_cols), dropping data from 'pair' times.
    c) (from (3)) (MSCDs after groupby(cell_cols, + ['wait_id']). this ignores
    'pair' times implicitly.
    d) (from (1)) MSDs each spot after groupby(cell_cols)
    e) (from (2)) MSDs of spot1 after groupby(cell_cols) and of spot2 ignoring
    "pair" times
    f) (from (3)) MSDs of spot1 after groupby(cell_cols) and of spot2 after
    groupby(cell_cols + ['wait_id'])
    g) (from (4)) MSDs of spot1 and spot2 after groupby(cell_cols+['wait_id']),
    ignoring spot2 whenever foci=='pair'. separately: the MSDs of the spot
    during "paired" times.

In our estimation, which of these makes sense depends on how we interpret what
is happening when the loci are paired. If there is a non-markovianity induced
by pairing, such as if the loci are fixed together by some external force at
that time, then only (c) and (g) likely make any sense.

on the other hand, if the diffusion of each locus does not change when they are
paired (such as would be the case if they were not binding, and only coming
into proximity), then (a/b) and (d/e) make sense, depending on whether our
resolution is high enough that we can safely assign a distance "0" to the loci
for the times at which we see them "paired" (otherwise, we will be skewing our
MSDs to the small side).

        columns by which to group the data in order to extract one trajectory
        per group. this allows calculation of different types of MSDs, as
        described below.
    groups : List[str]
        columns by which to perform the final groupby to get one MSD curve per
        group. this simply allows you to calculate e.g. one MSD per cell, or
        one MSD per experiment, etc. etc.

        a file name for the "vel" file if it is to be saved
    dims : List[Optional[str]]
